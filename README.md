Project Description
A simple and funny chatbot application built with React that uses the Gemini API to generate witty, argumentative, and often incorrect responses to user input.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The internet is filled with chatbots that are too helpful. They answer questions correctly, provide useful information, and are always polite. This creates an unrealistic standard of digital interaction. Where's the fun in that?

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
useless gpt is our answer to this crisis. It's a chatbot that guarantees a funny, slightly argumentative, and confidently incorrect response to every query. It's designed to lower your expectations and bring a little bit of chaos back to your conversations.
